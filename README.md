# VdiSchema
SQL and scripts to install the VDI control and datasets schemas

This repo includes a library of SQL scripts that create and drop the VDI schemas, and also the `installVdiSchema` program.

It is intended to be run within the GUS build system.

To run `installVdiSchema` standalone, clone the `SchemaInstallUtils` repo, and copy `SchemaInstallUtils/Main/lib/perl/SchemaInstallUtils.pm` into `VdiSchema/Main/lib/perl/SchemaInstallUtils/Main/Utils.pm`
